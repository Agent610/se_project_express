# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Front end Repo
[https://github.com/Agent610/se_project_react]

Project Description:
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

Project Technologies and Techniques used:
Throughout the back-end portion of this project the following technologies and techniques were used:
-Node.js: Built the server-side applications.
-Express.js: Built API calls also served as the framework.
-MongoDB: Served as the database area for saving the user data and preferences.
-Postman: Served as the testing site for API calls (as per subscription "Only 25 FULL runs were allowed per month). However single runs don't count as one of the 25 allowed per month.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
